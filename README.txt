This program is meant to be as modifiable as possible. the getData function curls and then greps, cuts, and seds out the id and the title of the video. You could modify this function, but good luck, it's a lot of regexes. The viewVideo function has a url as an input and plays the video. viewThumbnail takes an id as an input and displays the thumbnail of the video. To port this to another site, modify viewVideo, viewThumbnail, and getData to work for another site.
